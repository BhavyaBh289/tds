1.Write a menu-driven program that maintains a queue of passengers waiting to see a ticket agent. The program user should be able to insert a new passenger at the rear of the queue, display the passenger at the front of the queue, or remove the passenger at the front of the queue. The program will display the number of passengers left in the queue just before it terminates. DONE
